## 0.8.1 (current)

Bugfixes:

- Strip byte order mark from Strings when importing so they don't become part of imported content's cells. 
  See #97 for discussion. (#103) -- @lardieri
- Respect alternate delimiters when serializing the CSV.
  See #102 for discussion. (#107) -- @lardieri
- Escape any double-quotes embedded inside the field values when serializing the CSV.
  See #111 for discussion. -- @lardieri


## 0.8.0

API Changes:

- Replace namedRows/namedColumns and enumeratedRows/enumeratedColumns with CSV<Named> and CSV<Enumerated> types
  that both expose a rows/columns property with different types. This way you cannot screw up by trying to access
  an unpopulated array because the CSV was loaded wrongly. The type knows it all. (#76) -- @DivineDominion
    - CSV.namedRows/CSV.namedColumns and CSV.enumeratedRows/CSV.enumeratedColumns are removed.
    - NamedCSV/EnumeratedCSV type aliases are introduced to simplify access.
